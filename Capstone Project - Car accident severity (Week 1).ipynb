Accidents are nowadays really common.There are many types of collisions, including transportation, traffic, car accidents and so on. Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. This project will focus on predicting the severity of an accident, using the shared data for Seattle city as an example of how to deal with the accidents data. According to 37 different attributes, a supervised machine learning will be used to predict accidents to improve the predictability of the model. Using different sectors like weather, vehcount etc. is really important to avoid accidents. Once the problem confirmed, data understanding, preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment will be used to anaylse this situation. "

Then, the attributes (columns) that will be used to train the machine learning model should be determined. Also, we will assess the condition of chosen attributes by looking for trends, certain patterns, skewed information, correlations, and so on. Using the dataset given from Seattle Police Department, attributes can be used to weigh the severity of an accident are weather, vehcount and so on.\n- Data Preparation: The data preparation includes all the required activities to construct the final dataset which will be fed into the modeling tools. Data preparation can be performed multiple times and it includes balancing the labeled data, transformation, filling missing data, and cleaning the dataset."
